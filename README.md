# Welcome to Statistics & Machine Learning

We will be going through several Jupyter Notebooks during the tutorial and use a number of data science libraries along the way. The easiest way to get started is to download Anaconda, which is free and open source. When you download this, it comes with the Jupyter Notebook IDE and many popular data science libraries, so you donâ€™t have to install them one by one.
